###### What is this project about?

- u2l = Universal 2nd (Secondary) Language 通用语 
1. Easy: A well-designed language should be easy to learn (especially for zero-beginner).

2. Unambiguous (pronunciation). Every word has only one way to pronounce it. This should make immediate sense.

3. Concise: Able to express a full complete meaning with short/brief sentence.  

4. Creative: Users can have fun in creating new words.  

5. Scientific: Users can collaborate scientific & mathematical idea or jargon into the language to encourage exploratory spirit of fellow scientists. This language could overcome limitation, ambiguities & bias from some natural languages including English, Chinese, Arabic etc.



###### Why don't use existing natural language or conlang eg: Esperanto & Ido instead of creating a new language from scratch?

- Every language has its own pros & cons, so we'd like to make good use of all the pros & get rid of the unnecessities.



###### Why did you allow people to copy & distribute your hard work here?

- We believe a language is meant to unify people via communication, instead of discrimination. If our project failed for whatever reasons (political, social, or simply misunderstanding), we hope that your projects may make it for us. You can simply fork it & create an independent branch.
